# What is a Garden Nest ?
So recently I switched to Obsidian for my note taking purpose, and the deeper I went the more interested I became. So basically it organizes our notes into a graph or mind Map and accordingly We can make relations between each notes until it turns into its own neuron network. So basically a **Digital Garden** is nothing but a subset or superset of my thought graph. This website is going to be a version of my Digital Garden where I will share pretty cool tutorials as well as tips and tricks. Please find a list of articles at the side of this window.

*this is an example of how we can maintain a relation in between our notes or thoughts just like a second brain*
